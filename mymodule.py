# # NOTE Python module
# # Consider a module to be the same as code library
# # A file containing a set of functions you want to include your application.

# # Create a module
# # To create a module just save the code you want in a file with the file extension .py

# def greeting(name):
#     print("Hello, " + name)

# # Use a module
# # Now we can use the module we just created, by using the "import" statement:

# # Example
# # Import the module name mymodule, and call the greeting function:

# # The module can contain functions, as already described, but also variables of all types (arrays, dictionaries, object etc):

# # Example:
# # Save this code in the file mymodule.py
# person = {
#     "name": "John",
#     "age" : 36,
#     "country": "Norway"
# }
